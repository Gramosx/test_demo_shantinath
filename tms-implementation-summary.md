# TMS Frontend Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Core Structure**:
   - Project folder structure following Angular best practices
   - Core data models and enums for the application
   - Service architecture for authentication, organizations, tenders, and holidays
   - HTTP interceptor for authentication
   - Auth and role-based guards for route protection

2. **Authentication**:
   - Login functionality with JWT-based auth
   - AuthService for managing authentication state
   - Secure token storage

3. **Layout**:
   - Main application layout with responsive sidebar
   - Material Design integration
   - Dashboard layout and statistics components

4. **Routing**:
   - Lazy-loaded feature modules
   - Route guards for protected routes
   - Role-based access control

## What Needs to Be Completed

### Angular Material Integration
The application uses Angular Material for UI components. You need to:
1. Install Angular Material: `ng add @angular/material`
2. Configure your application to use Angular Material properly

### Feature Module Implementation
The feature modules (Organization, Tender, Holiday) need component implementations:

1. **Organization Module**:
   - Organization list component
   - Organization detail component
   - Organization form component for add/edit

2. **Tender Module**:
   - Tender list component
   - Tender detail component
   - Tender form component with date calculations

3. **Holiday Module**:
   - Holiday list component
   - Holiday form component

### Core Components
1. **Country Service** integration with API or static data
2. **Date Calculator** integration for business day calculations

### Additional Requirements
1. **Form components** need to be implemented with reactive forms
2. **Date pickers** integration with business day logic
3. **Country selection** filtering for organizations
4. **Error handling** and loading state management
5. **Unit tests** for components and services

## Next Steps

1. Install Angular Material:
   ```
   npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk
   ```

2. Update package.json with required dependencies:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@angular/animations": "^16.0.0",
     "@angular/cdk": "^16.0.0",
     "@angular/common": "^16.0.0",
     "@angular/compiler": "^16.0.0",
     "@angular/core": "^16.0.0",
     "@angular/forms": "^16.0.0",
     "@angular/material": "^16.0.0",

     "@angular/router": "^16.0.0",
     "rxjs": "~7.8.0",
     "tslib": "^2.3.0",
     "zone.js": "~0.13.0"
   }
   ```

3. Install Tailwind CSS for additional styling:
   ```
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

4. Implement the feature components following the established patterns
5. Integrate with backend API endpoints
6. Add comprehensive error handling and loading indicators
